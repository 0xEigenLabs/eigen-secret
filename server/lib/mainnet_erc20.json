The FANTOM platform adopts a new protocol known as the “Lachesis Protocol” to maintain consensus. This protocol is intended to be integrated into the Fantom OPERA Chain. The aim is to allow applications built on top of the FANTOM OPERA Chain to enjoy instant transactions and near zero transaction costs for all users. \r\n\r\nThe mission of FANTOM is to provide compatibility between all transaction bodies around the world, and create an ecosystem which allows real-time transactions and data sharing with low cost.",

        "description": "The Livepeer project aims to deliver a live video streaming network protocol that is fully decentralized, highly scalable, crypto token incentivized, and results in a solution which can serve as the live media layer in the decentralized development (web3) stack. In addition, Livepeer is meant to provide an economically efficient alternative to centralized broadcasting solutions for any existing broadcaster. In this document we describe the Livepeer Protocol - a delegated stake based protocol for incentivizing participants in a live video broadcast network in a game-theoretically secure way. We present solutions for the scalable verification of decentralized work, as well as the prevention of useless work in an attempt to game the token allocations in an inflationary system.\r\n\r\nThe Livepeer Token (LPT) is the protocol token of the Livepeer network. But it is not the medium of exchange token. Broadcasters use Ethereum's Ether (ETH) to broadcast video on the network. Nodes who contribu...",

This distinguishes FUZE as a token created entirely for its community.\r\n\r\nWhat’s the purpose of the FUZE project?\r\nOur main goal is to build a community that decides in which direction the FUZE Token should go. Future functions or use-cases can be built by any member of the community. Of course, the main function right now is the deflationary token model — this means the total supply decreases with each transaction.\r\n\r\nWhy a deflationary token?\r\nWe like the concept of this kind of token model because it exemplifies the hodler mentality.

It is solving the urgent problem of scalability and high fees by implementing a variant of optimistic roll-ups. Most notably, Cartesi is revolutionizing smart contract programming by allowing developers to code with mainstream software stacks instead of Solidity. Noether is Cartesi's side-chain that’s optimized for ephemeral data, providing low-cost data availability to DApps.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Cartesi Unique?\r\n\r\nWhat gives Cartesi a competitive edge is that it allows developers to code their smart contracts and DApps directly with mainstream software components and Linux OS resources. This is a breakthrough for the productivity of existing DApp developers and for the adoption of non-blockchain developers. This is a necessary step to the very future of blockchains and their applications.

High costs to consumers and merchants, slow blockchain confirmations, wildly fluctuating currency values – all of this barred the way from adopting a cryptocurrency as a globally accepted payment method.\r\n\r\nUntil now.

The collateral for the coin is held trustlessly in smart contracts, so users don’t have to rely on third parties to confirm or redeem. OMC has all the features that make Bitcoin so appealing but it doesn’t suffer from the same volatility or protracted transaction times, making it much more usable as a store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account. Ormeus Cash offers a bright glimpse of a future in which virtual currency becomes the norm ...",

Their ratio in the pool will be based on the supply and demand of the market. Depositing a coin with a lesser ratio will yield the user a higher percentage of the pool. As such when the ratio is heavily tilted to one of the coins, it may serve as a good chance to arbitrage.\r\n\r\nCurve Finance also supports yield-bearing tokens.

FLOW is designed to be a hedge against Bitcoin as today’s primary digital store of value.\r\n\r\nThe protocol distributes inflation of FLOW tokens to all addresses holding it without the need for a single transaction. Inflation happens daily and does not require any action on the side of the FLOW token holder or any other parties. This method of inflation allows for the token to be applied to modern DeFi use cases without diluting the token holders.\r\n\r\nOver a period of 10 years, inflation is reduced and ends with a capped supply of FLOW tokens.\r\n\r\nFLOW does not need to be staked or locked into a contract to receive inflation, therefore it can be applied to the full range of DeFi applications while still achieving its distribution target.",

        "description": "Rootkit is a highly advanced new DeFi protocol that pushes the limits of financial wizardry. Using a combination of permanent liquidity locks and a fixed supply currency, Rootkit creates a mathematical price floor. There can only ever be 10000 ROOT, and the price floor represents the lowest possible price a ROOT token can ever be. With our new ERC-31337 token wrapper, Rootkit is able to unlock the ETH from under the price floor and send it to a vault. This ETH is moved without effecting the market price, or depth of the order book. As the price floor rises through market volume, liquidity locks. Which means more ETH is unlocked from below the floor and sent to the vault. Because there is no tokens available to sell, the floor starts at the price, which is determined by how many ETH are raised in the ETH.

Unlike other insurance protocols, the governance token is not used for underwriting risk. \r\n\r\nTo bootstrap coverage for a new protocol, market makers will need to be incentivized to stake collateral of DAI/yDAI to mint CLAIM and NOCLAIM tokens. All series covers a specified protocol and have a specified expiry date. During the expiry date, either CLAIM or NOCLAIM will have the full claim to the collaterals. \r\n\r\nFor example, if 100 DAI is used to provide coverage for Compound protocol until an expiry date, it will yield 100 CLAIM and 100 NOCLAIM tokens. On the expiry date, if there is a valid claim event, every CLAIM token will receive 1 DAI while NOCLAIM token will expire worthless. The converse is true if there is no valid claim event. In this case, every NOCLAIM token will receive 1 DAI while CLAIM token will expire worthless.",
